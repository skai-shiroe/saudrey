## The Future of Low-Code/No-Code

The low-code/no-code movement is rapidly evolving:

- **AI Integration**: Intelligent suggestions and automated code generation
- **Advanced Customization**: More flexibility for complex requirements
- **Industry-Specific Solutions**: Tailored platforms for specific sectors
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining low-code with traditional development

## Getting Started

1. **Assess Your Needs**: Identify the type of application you want to build
2. **Choose a Platform**: Research and select the best fit for your requirements
3. **Learn the Platform**: Take tutorials and build simple prototypes
4. **Start Small**: Begin with a minimal viable product
5. **Scale Gradually**: Expand functionality as you gain experience

Low-code and no-code platforms are democratizing web development, making it possible for anyone with an idea to bring it to life. While they may not replace traditional development for every use case, they offer powerful tools for rapid innovation and problem-solving.

## Avatar

Replace the `public/images/skai.jpg` file with your own avatar image. It is used on the `/about` page as well as on the dynamically generated `open-graph` images.

## Favicon

Replace the `src/app/favicon.ico` file with your own favicon.

## Content

Replace the content in the `resources/content.js` file with your own content. You can use custom components in most cases, since the props are usually declared as `ReactNode` instead of `string`, but it's important that you need to import them in the file.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="1-2"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`import { InlineCode } from "@once-ui-system/core";
import Link from "next/link";

const person = {
  ...
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/content.js"
  }
]} />

The imports above would let us use `InlineCode` and `Link` components in the content file.

### Personal details

Your personal details are used across the whole app to render personalized headings, labels and images. Languages are displayed on the `/about` page, and location and time in the header.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="2-3,7-10"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const person = {
    firstName: "Selene",
    lastName: "Yu",
    get name() {
      return "...";
    },
    role: "Design Engineer",
    avatar: "/images/skai.jpg",
    location: "Asia/Jakarta", // Expecting the IANA time zone identifier, e.g., 'Europe/Vienna'
    languages: ["English", "Bahasa"], // optional: Leave the array empty if you don't want to display languages
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/content.js"
  }
]} />

### Social links

Social links are rendered on the `/about` page and in the footer based on the array configured in the `social` object. You can set custom icons to each, but don't forget to import them in `src/once-ui/icons.ts`. Read the Once UI documentation](https://once-ui.com/docs/icons) for more information.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const social = [
    {
      name: "GitHub",
      icon: "github",
      link: "https://github.com/once-ui-system/nextjs-starter",
    },
    {
      name: "Email",
      icon: "email",
      link: "mailto:lorant@once-ui.com",
    },
];`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/content.js"
  }
]} />

### Pages

Each page have it's own object that manages the personalized content, such as headings, subheadings, images and dynamic data.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const home = {
    label: "Home",
    title: "Selene Yu's Portfolio",
    description: "Portfolio website showcasing my work as a Design Engineer",
    headline: <>Design engineer and builder</>,
    subline: (
      <>
        I'm Selene, a design engineer at <InlineCode>FLY</InlineCode>, where I craft intuitive
        <br /> user experiences. After hours, I build my own projects.
      </>
    ),
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/content.js"
  }
]} />

The `label` property is used in the header navigation. The `title` property is used for the page title and the `description` property is used for the page description. They are also used in meta- and open graph tags.
