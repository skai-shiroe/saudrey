## Overview

Design and implementation of a web application for managing **tax registration requests**.  
The system allows service agents to create and validate request batches, while registration officers process them. An administration interface manages users, centers, permissions, and performance monitoring.

## Key Features

- **Request Batches**: Agents can group multiple registration requests into baskets for easier validation.
- **Processing Workflow**: Registration officers handle validated requests with status tracking.
- **Administration Panel**: Management of users, roles, and centers with permission-based access control.
- **Performance Analytics**: Metrics and dashboards to monitor agent productivity and request processing times.
- **Audit Trail**: History of modifications and rejected requests with rejection reasons.

## Technologies Used

- **Elysia.js (Bun)**: For a performant backend with structured routing.
- **PostgreSQL + Prisma**: Database and ORM for structured queries and schema management.
- **Next.js + TypeScript**: For a dynamic and secure frontend.
- **Swagger**: For API documentation and testing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and professional UI design.

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was implementing a **workflow system** that aligned with existing administrative procedures while remaining intuitive. Designing **role-based access** was also crucial to secure sensitive data. Through this project, I gained expertise in **complex state management** and **multi-role workflows**.

## Outcome

The system provides a **centralized digital solution** for tax registration requests, reducing paperwork, improving transparency, and enabling better monitoring of agent performance.
